### Question 1:
> What's your proudest achievement? Something you've done in work, some random side project, code or otherwise. Just make sure you explain what it is that makes you so proud of it.

I was really proud of the *Gods of Giza* game I programmed while working at Genesis. 
It was a difficult project, I met the deadline, and it turned out to be a popular game with 41,000 + players.

### Question 2:
> What's the most interesting technical article you've read recently? What did you like about it and why should we take a look at it?

https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/
I like that it uses a simple and clean solution to common css and website layout issues. 
If you have not tried to use Flexbox in css before it's definately worth reading.

### Question 3:
> Write some code that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4]. This is an opportunity to show us your understanding of computer science fundamentals. Avoid using built-in language methods like Array.flatten

See flatten directory.

### Question 4:
> Write a web application which:
Uses the medal data in olympics_2008_medalists.json to rank countries by total medals won in descending order.
Displays the total medal count per country, as well as total gold, silver and bronze per country.
It should filter the countries by gold, silver, or bronze medals.
Style it as you see fit. Feel free to be creative.
Complete this task as if you intend shipping it to production. Tests are required.
